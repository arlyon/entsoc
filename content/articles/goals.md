We are a group of passionate people coming together to get out and see
what Edinburgh has to offer to new entrepreneurs who want to avoid
corporate dystopia. Together, we arrange events focused on various
aspects of running a business. Our main goals to are to

- **Empower** people with business ideas, giving them the tools they need to succeed.
- **Encourage** students not to join big corporate firms that have little focus and make their own path.
- **Enable** connections between students that give a shit about their future and the future of humanity.

To achieve that we take a very lean approach. No membership fees, no
mandatory meetings, no busywork; we focus all our energy on doing
things we want to do and if there's something you'd like to do we
encourage you to get out there and make it happen.

Our current interests are within technology, engineering, software
development and innovation. If this sounds like your thing, you can get
in touch with us or just come along to one of our [events](/events).
