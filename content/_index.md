HackSock is an open non-profit community at Heriot Watt based around
technology, innovation, programming, entrepreneurship and prototyping.
We want to build a space to meet like minded people and build cool shit.

We host events to encourage rapid development of ideas, in fields from
game-dev to peer-to-peer. Anything cool projects that arise we pursue together.
