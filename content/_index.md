The Heriot-Watt entrepreneurship society is an open non-profit community
based around technology, innovation, programming, and learning.
We want to build a space to meet like minded people and work together.

We host courses and events to encourage rapid development of ideas, covering all
aspects of running a successful tech business. If that sounds like
your thing, let us know.
