To kick off our year, we invited Heriot-Watt alumni Selby Cary and his
business partner Mike McDonald to speak about their foray into the
world of entrepreneurship. The spoke to us about their company [Casta
Spes Technologies](https://cstechnologies.co.uk/) and some of the
lessons they learned in the first few years of their journey. Filled
with anecdotes and stories it was refreshing to get a more personal
perspective rather than a business perspective. It was a great first
session to get our feet wet and build some idea of what's to come.

Thanks guys!

Slides and additional links from the talk will follow soon.
